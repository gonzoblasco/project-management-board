# Basic Project Management Board

**(just Front End using internal JSON)**

This is a really simple project where I used **High Order Components**, **Styled Components** and **HTML5 Drag and Drop**, allowing user to arrange their tasks in the respected lane.

Created by Gonzalo Blasco @gonzoblasco based on the project you can find in the book React Projects from _Packt Publisher_.
