# Basic Project Management Board

## (just Front End using internal JSON)

This is a really simple project where I used _High Order Components_, _Styled Components_ and _HTML5 Drag and Drop_, allowing user to arrange their tasks in the respected lane.

Created by Gonzalo Blasco @gonzoblasco based on the project you can find in the book React Projects from _Packt Publisher_.
